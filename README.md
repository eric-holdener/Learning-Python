# Learning-Python
This repository is for the quizzes and practices at the end of each chapter while moving through the "Learning Python" book by Mark Lutz. I already have a firm grasp of Python, but am going through this entire book as a double check to make sure I have a firm foundation before moving on to more advanced data related learning.
